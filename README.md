# Efficient-Video-Generation-on-Complex-Datasets

Artificial Intelligence can generate realistic videos by learning from YouTube clips at DeepMind

Video synthesis and modeling with Dual Video Discriminator GAN (DVD-GAN) 
scales to longer and higher resolution videos by leveraging a computationally efficient decomposition of its discriminator.

It can generate coherent 256 x 256-pixel videos of “notable fidelity” up to 48 frames in length.
